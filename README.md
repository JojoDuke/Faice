# Faice App
## Overview
A react app that uses the [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/) to detect whether an image uploaded is a persons face or not. I realized that it kinda only works on full, non-accessorized faces so no masks or glasses sadly. I was able to do this following a course by Andrei Neagoie.
